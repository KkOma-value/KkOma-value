# Hi there, I'm Joseph! 👋

A playful coder with **2 years** of coding adventures — mostly wandering through the Java jungle 🌱, but also dabbling in other languages along the way.

I love building little toys and sharing them here. They might be small, but each one is made with lots of curiosity and a bit of magic ✨.

### 🛠️ Tech Playground

- **Main Quest:** Java  
- **Side Quests:** Python (learning passionately!), JavaScript, and a sprinkle of other languages  
- **Current Obsession:** AI Application Development 🤖  
- **Goal:** Building smarter apps and falling deeper into the AI rabbit hole 🐇☕

---

### 🧪 What You’ll Find Here  
- Fun little projects 🎮🪀  
- Experiments with AI integrations  
- Code that sometimes works on the first try (usually not 😅)  
- A work-in-progress developer sharing his progress 🚧

---

### 🌱 Currently  
- Sharpening my **Python** skills for AI and beyond  
- Exploring AI APIs, ML models, and how to make things “smart”  
- Hoping to meet cool people who know about this stuff — **feel free to teach me!** 🙏

---

### 💡 Fun Facts  
- I believe AI will eventually write my READMEs for me (wait, is it already?)  
- I turn coffee ☕ into code… and sometimes into bugs 🐞  
- If I’m not coding, I’m probably thinking about coding… or AI.
